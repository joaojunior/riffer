# MCP

Riffer can consume third-party [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) servers as tool sources. Tools are discovered automatically at registration time — no handwritten Ruby per tool required.

## Overview

1. Register an MCP server globally with `Riffer::Mcp.register`.
2. Opt an agent into that server's tools using the `use_mcp` DSL.
3. The agent picks up the tools and calls them like any other Riffer tool.

## Registering a Server

```ruby
Riffer::Mcp.register(
  name: "github",        # unique identifier
  tags: [:github],       # agents opt-in by tag
  endpoint: "https://mcp.github.com",
  discovery_headers: -> { {"Authorization" => "Bearer #{ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN']}"} }
)
```

`register` returns immediately. Tool discovery runs in a background thread. Use `on_pending` (see below) to control agent behaviour while discovery is in progress.

### Discovery headers

`discovery_headers` is a Hash or Proc used **only** for MCP `tools/list` when the discovery client is built (the Proc runs once at that time). Use it for bootstrap identity: service account, env-based token, or `{}` if listing is unauthenticated.

Optional **`credentials_scope`** on the manifest documents whether you expect invocation headers to depend on tenant and/or user keys in the agent `context` (e.g. `:global`, `:tenant`, `:user`). It does **not** store tenant or user ids — only a hint for your app and docs. For multi-tenant apps, `:user` often means “user in tenant” and your `context` may include both tenant and user identifiers.

## Session credentials callback

When **`Riffer.config.mcp.credentials`** is set to a Proc, each MCP `tools/call` resolves HTTP headers through that callback instead of reusing `discovery_headers`.

**Signature:**

```ruby
Riffer.configure do |config|
  config.mcp.credentials = lambda do |manifest:, matched_tags:, context:|
    # return nil to omit this server's tools for this agent run (at resolve time)
    # return Hash<String,String> headers for tools/call (e.g. Authorization)
  end
end
```

- **`manifest`** — the server's `Riffer::Mcp::Manifest`.
- **`matched_tags`** — intersection of the agent's `use_mcp` tags and `manifest.tags` for this registration (unioned across multiple `use_mcp` lines).
- **`context`** — the same hash passed to `generate` / `stream` for this run.

**Resolve time:** Before tools are exposed to the model, the proc is invoked once per matching registration. If it returns **`nil`**, that server's tools are omitted for this run (e.g. tenant has no integration).

**Call time:** Authenticated tool wrappers invoke the proc again for each execution. If it returns **`nil`**, `Riffer::Mcp::CredentialsDeniedError` is raised.

If **`credentials` is unset**, discovery and `tools/call` share one client built from `discovery_headers` (same behaviour as a single static token for both list and call).

## Tags

Tags are entirely up to your application; Riffer does not define a canonical vocabulary. Each server may declare multiple tags; an agent includes every registration that shares **any** tag passed to `use_mcp`.

When MCPs are registered, assign **stable bucket tags** so agent classes can opt in without listing every server name—for example `tags: [:connectors, :github]` with `use_mcp :connectors` for all enabled connectors, or `use_mcp :github` for that integration only.

Registrations are **global** (endpoint + tags); **tenant and user** access are enforced in your **`credentials`** proc and whatever you put in **`context`**, not by putting ids on the manifest.

## Opting an Agent In

```ruby
class ResearchAgent < Riffer::Agent
  model "openai/gpt-4o"
  instructions "You are a research assistant."

  use_mcp :github
end
```

`use_mcp` accepts any tag registered via `Riffer::Mcp.register`. Multiple calls accumulate — the agent receives tools from all matching servers:

```ruby
class MultiAgent < Riffer::Agent
  model "openai/gpt-4o"

  use_mcp :github
  use_mcp :jira
end
```

MCP tools are appended after any tools declared with `uses_tools`.

## Handling Pending Servers

Discovery is asynchronous. When an agent runs before a server is ready, the `on_pending` strategy determines what happens:

| Strategy | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `:ignore` | Tools from that server are omitted (default) |
| `:wait` | Blocks until ready or `wait_timeout` seconds, then raises `TimeoutError` |
| `:raise` | Immediately raises `NotReadyError` |

Set the global default:

```ruby
Riffer.configure do |config|
  config.mcp.on_pending = :wait
  config.mcp.wait_timeout = 30  # seconds
end
```

Override per `use_mcp` call:

```ruby
use_mcp :github, on_pending: :wait
use_mcp :jira, on_pending: :ignore
```

## Unregistering a Server

```ruby
Riffer::Mcp.unregister("github")
```

Subsequent agent runs will not include tools from that server. Call `register` again (with fresh `discovery_headers` if needed) to re-register.

## Introspection

```ruby
Riffer::Mcp.registrations
# => {"github" => #<Riffer::Mcp::Registration ...>, ...}

reg = Riffer::Mcp.registrations["github"]
reg.ready?   # => true / false
reg.tools    # => [<Class:...>, ...]  (Riffer::Tool subclasses)
reg.agent    # => <Class:...>         (Riffer::Agent subclass)
```

## Error Classes

| Class | Raised when |
|-------|-------------|
| `Riffer::Mcp::NotReadyError` | `on_pending: :raise` and server not ready |
| `Riffer::Mcp::TimeoutError` | `on_pending: :wait` and `wait_timeout` exceeded |
| `Riffer::Mcp::CredentialsDeniedError` | `credentials` proc returns `nil` during `tools/call` |

All inherit from `Riffer::Mcp::Error < Riffer::Error`.

## Requirements

The `mcp` gem is a runtime dependency of Riffer. The HTTP transport requires `faraday`:

```ruby
gem "faraday"
```
